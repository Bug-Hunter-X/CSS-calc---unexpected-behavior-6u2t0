The CSS property `calc()` can produce unexpected results if you are not careful with operator precedence and units. For example, the following code might not produce the expected result: `width: calc(100% - 10px);`  If the parent element doesn't have a defined width, the calculation will fail.  Another issue can arise when using different units within the same `calc()` expression without proper conversion, leading to incorrect calculations.
