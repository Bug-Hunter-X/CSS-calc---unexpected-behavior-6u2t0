To fix the issues, ensure that:

1. **Parent element has a defined width:** If you're subtracting a pixel value from a percentage, the parent container must have its width explicitly set or inherit a width from its parent. 
2. **Consistent units:** Use consistent units throughout the `calc()` expression. If mixing units, ensure proper conversion. 
3. **Operator precedence:** Use parentheses `()` to control the order of operations if needed for complex calculations.  

Here's corrected code:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
.container {
  width: 500px; /* Explicit width for the parent */
}

.element {
  width: calc(100% - 20px); /* Consistent units */
}

.element2 {
  width: calc((100% - 20px) / 2); /* Example with parentheses */
}
```
